# A faster open-source alternative to CodeX

The [original CodeX tool](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kisslicer-refugee-camp/ZMuIrtn5Mfo)
can convert G-code in the form of `.bfb` files to `.cubepro` and `.cubex`
files for the CubePro and CubeX lines of 3D-printers.
However, CodeX is quite slow, especially when run on Linux or OSX using wine,
where processing a small file can take several hours.

The cube-encoder in this project is a faster alternative to CodeX, written in plain C.
